Subject: [PATCH 118/127] QObjectPrivate::Signal: initialize all members

A recent change in that area triggered Clang-SA to rescan the code and
complain about this pre-existing bug: If receiver == nullptr, then the
`previous` member was never initialized.

Fix by null'ing it using NSDMI. This is a trivial type, the compiler
will be able to avoid the redundant write.

Amends ab92b9e40025dcf08c14232de762a268201a78b4(!).

Pick-to: 6.7 6.6 6.5 6.2 5.15
