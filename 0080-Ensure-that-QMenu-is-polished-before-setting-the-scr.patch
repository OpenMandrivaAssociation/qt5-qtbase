Subject: [PATCH 080/171] Ensure that QMenu is polished before setting the
 screen in popup()

Some styles alter the widget that will influence the underlying platform
window. An example is when a style would want to draw the menu with some
transparency and sets the Qt::WA_TranslucentBackground attribute. This
needs to happen before the platform window is created. However calling
QWidgetPrivate::setScreen will end up creating the window and the
surface format will be fixed at this point.
